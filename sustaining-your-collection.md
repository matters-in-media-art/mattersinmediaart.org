Our aim is to provide information that is useful to those who are caring for their own collection of video artworks outside an institution, as well as small, medium and large organisations. Throughout these pages key principles are highlighted and approaches are suggested depending on the size of your collection and your available resources, namely skills, budget and infrastructure. For each section we invite you to fill in a survey, this will act as a tool to help you to outline the needs of your collection. The results will form the basis for an overall preservation system design.

###Core Principles

* Do to digital works as you would to any art work: identify, catalog, describe, treat, document, and track
* Be prepared to be unprepared: the necessary skills evolve constantly and will be found both within and beyond your walls
* Build storage for your present collection but lay groundwork for the future
* The budget to build collection storage is nothing without the budget to sustain it
* Digital collections require active maintenance and will not survive passive storage


#Core Practices 

##Your collection

###Collection size and characteristics

To plan and develop a system for digital art you will need to know some details about your collection and its possible growth. 
* Record descriptive and technical information about the works
* Capture information on both born-digital items and legacy material that will be migrated
* Monitor the growth patterns of your collection 
* Establish which collections are in the scope of your digital storage project

###Collection size and characteristics

To plan and develop a system for digital art you will need to know some details about your collection and its possible growth. 
* Record descriptive and technical information about the works
* Capture information on both born-digital items and legacy material that will be migrated
* Monitor the growth patterns of your collection 
* Establish which collections are in the scope of your digital storage project

###Budget
Your budget may include costs for both preparing your collection for storage and establishing your storage infrastructure. 

* Legacy media migration
* Initial storage infrastructure
* Ongoing maintenance 
* Replacement and upgrade (every 5 years)
* Growth 
* People with expertise
* Consumables

###Skills

To build a team able to address the needs of your collection: 
* Acquire new skills through workshops, research and conferences
* Leverage professional networks and community resources
* If you are in an institution, bring together staff from acorss departments, and collaborate with others outside your institution
* Consider the need for new roles and expertise 


#Your Systems

##Collection Management

[IMAGE]

Your collection management system is an essential complement to your storage infrastructure, and should enable you to: 
* Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all collection items
* Record acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information
* Record exhibition or displays history, including loans
* Track the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated
* Record condition information and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management

##Storage Infrastructure

Ensure that your storage infrastructure provides for:

* Geographic redundancy - multiple copies of data should be held at different geographical locations, and a disaster recovery plan should be in place
* Fixity checking - regularly monitoring digital files in order to detect corruption or unwanted changes to your data 
* Access and security - the speed and restriction of access to data needs to be appropriate for its intended use and the level of protection required.  
* Technology monitoring - trends in storage technology should be monitored to assess when migration to new storage media will be necessary


#Scoping Your Context

The best way to approach the challenge of sustaining your digital art depends on your context; a key element of this context is the nature of your collection. This section therefore focuses on assessing key facts about your collection of digital art, for example how large it is and what types of formats exist. The survey provided in this section is designed to help you to gather all the core information.

There are Core Principles that underpin the management of digital collections; however there are different ways (systems, tools, and procedures) to realise these Core Principles. The best way forward will depend on your context, i.e. the size of your collection, your infrastructure, available expertise and budget. This survey has been designed to help you to establish an overview of your digital collection.

The first step to planning what you need is understanding what you have, and how it might grow.

##Storage Infrastructure
Ensure that your storage infrastructure provides for:
* Geographic redundancy - multiple copies of data should be held at different geographical locations, and a disaster recovery plan should be in place
* Fixity checking - regularly monitoring digital files in order to detect corruption or unwanted changes to your data 
* Access and security - the speed and restriction of access to data needs to be appropriate for its intended use and the level of protection required.  
* Technology monitoring - trends in storage technology should be monitored to assess when migration to new storage media will be necessary


## Scoping your resources

### Budget
When developing a budget for costs associated with the development and implementation of storage for digital art collections, there are two different types of cost to consider: capital costs (one-time purchases of fundamental infrastructure or tools that will in theory last years) and ongoing or recurring costs that will become part of regular operating budgets and may increase as your collections grow.

### Skills 

The management of digital artworks requires different skills, and teamwork is essential. New skills may be acquired through education and training of existing staff, establishing new collaborations, or by hiring new staff or modifying job descriptions. Larger organisations might be able to pull together a team from across departments who together have these skills. 
If you are taking care of your own work, or if you are in a small organization, relationships with external providers may be a key way of accessing those who have the necessary skills.

## Scoping your systems

### Collection Management 


[Image]

Whether you are an individual artist or large institution, the first step in sustaining your digital art is knowing what you have, where it is located and how you do things.  
Most museums and large institutions have comprehensive collection management databases for tracking their artworks, and digital storage for their data infrastructure. In museums, databases are usually managed by the registration and collections management department, and data storage is usually in the realm of IT. In order to evaluate your current systems for the management of collection information for digital artworks, talk to the registration and collections management teams as well as any IT staff supporting the systems. It is important to find out how current management systems are functioning, what they are technically capable of, for example what backup systems are already in place.
No matter which collection management system you currently use, as you work through "Scoping Your Context" it is likely that the type of information you will need to scope your collection may already be found within this system, or alternatively you might want to add the information you generate through this process to your inventory. 
In most cases the information about an art collection will be formed of a rich cluster of records that have been compiled and edited over time. Often only a fraction of this information is held within a central database. Many institutions will also have records management systems for this associated documentation.

[inline of survey]

###Storage Infrastructure 

The problem of bit preservation of data has been solved, however it does require careful management.
These same principles can be applied to a small personal collection of material as well as a fully automated system used within a museum.
When scoping your current storage infrastructure for the purposes of digital preservation it is helpful to understand the difference between standard storage setups and those suitable for digital preservation. Standard storage systems are designed for digital objects that are in active use and while backup procedures are usually included, they generally do not meet the more stringent requirements to ensure long term preservation of data. For example, within a normal institutional information technology set up, it is standard practice for backup tapes to be wiped and re-used after a few months. Active use storage is also unlikely to have a system in place to identify that information has changed or been lost as when data is changing all the time it is not possible to easily detect the difference between intended changes and accidental changes or damage to important data. In contrast, preservation storage systems require the active monitoring of data in order to detect unwanted changes such as corruption. They also have high level of redundancy meaning that material is copied in a number of locations to enable the data to be restored should a problem arise and they will also have a disaster recovery plan.
In assessing your current storage infrastructure it may be useful to ask the following questions:



[inline of survey]

###Digital Repository 

What is a digital repository?
A digital repository for your collection is about more than just storage. There are many functions that can be carried out by a digital repository system in order to monitor and ensure the ongoing preservation of your collection objects. Just as for Collection Management systems, the way these functions are implemented will depend on individual circumstances. For a small, homogenous collection, many of these functions could be carried out manually. For a larger and more varied collection, there are significant benefits to having automated workflows and systems in place.
This is an area which has developed very rapidly in recent years, and many organisations have struggled to develop the infrastructure to keep pace with their growing digital collections. It is therefore important to understand that the term repository refers to a number of functions which need to be carried out and which are underpinned by some of the key ideas to emerge regarding digital preservation practice. 

These functions include:

* Automated workflows for the ingest of digital objects, including the extraction of metadata and packaging of the object and metadata for storage
* Generation of a persistent identifier for each digital object and a permanent relationship to associated metadata
* Generation of normalised masters where necessary. A normalised master is a preservation copy of a file in a standardised format. There is some debate regarding when the creation of normalised copies is advisable. In general video file formats are less vulnerable to obsolescence than tape formats. This is partly because it is easier to support software playback over time especially given open source tools such as ffmpeg. 
* Generation of access derivatives and an interface for user access to these derivatives, alongside associated metadata
* Generation of exhibition copies
* Auditing of system and user activities
* Active monitoring of file integrity
* Recording and reporting on collection characteristics, such as file formats
* Monitoring of preservation risks, e.g. file obsolescence and software dependencies

  <div class="collapsible-body"><p>A conservator of any type of material has a responsibility to understand and carefully document decisions made which impact the history of that material. This is also the case for digital video. The conservator is responsible for keeping careful records which reflect an understanding of what is important to preserve about a work and what the likely risks are of not being able to maintain particular properties of a work. Within a contemporary art context the artist is central to decisions regarding what is important to preserve about a work and this ongoing dialogue with the artist is an important element of what is recorded. There is an increasing acceptance within contemporary art conservation that a work of art will evolve and change over time and managing and documenting these changes is an increasingly important part of the role of the conservator.</p></div>

##Information Systems
Whether you are an individual artist or large institution the first step in sustaining your digital video art is knowing what you have and where it is located. An inventory could range from an excel spreadsheet, a database like Filemaker, an open source collection management software such as CollectiveAccess (http://www.collectiveaccess.org/about) or Omeka (http://omeka.org/about/) to the type of collection management system employed by museums, for example The Museum System (TMS), Mimsy or a bespoke system developed by your institution. No matter which of these systems is used, as you work through "Scoping Your Context" it is likely that the type of information you will need to scope your collection may already be found within this system, or alternatively you might want to add the information you generate through this process to your inventory.

Most museums and large institutions have comprehensive collection management databases for tracking their artworks, and digital storage for their data infrastructure. In Museums, databases are usually managed by the registration and collections management department, and data storage is usually in the realm of IT. In order to evaluate your current systems for the management of collection information for digital video, talk to the registration and collections management teams as well as any IT staff supporting the systems. It is important to find out how current management systems are functioning, what they are technically capable of, for example what backup systems are already in place.

### Catalogue
Depending on the scale of your collection and your systems you may decide to keep information about the artwork (for example installation instructions, acquisition details, exhibition history, documentation, conservation records, artist interviews, rights and contracts) in your repository alongside your digital video file. For larger institutions who have collections management systems which manage a complete collection, including non digital objects, there will be conventions for records management. In this situation the risks of developing a unique system of records management for digital objects may be greater than conforming to an institutional wide policy. Example risks in this situation are siloing your digital video collection, creating a situation where integration is difficult, falling outside standard upgrades of databases etc. However, if you manage a small collection and you do not have a robust collection management system that is fully supported it may represent a lower risk to store information about the artwork and its history alongside the digital video file.

Whichever solution you chose it is essential that you can access the information held within the repository and relate it to any records held outside the repository. For example, you can store information about the artwork in your records management system while the digital file is kept in a digital repository.

Every artwork should have a unique ID that can be identified across systems. Most collections have a system of assigning accession numbers, for example at MoMA 45.2014 would be a unique number which refers to the 45th work acquired in 2014. For Tate T01234 is simply a unique number assigned at acquisition. These accession numbers may also be underpinned by alternate numbers which allow for a persistent link between the artwork and its associated information.

Many artworks have associated with them a number of components. For digital video these may be different exhibition formats, access copies or archival formats. A digital video artwork may also be made up of multiple channels of video with a discrete file for each channel. It is useful to create component numbers for these items for example

45.2014.x1, 45.2014.x2, 45.2014.x3, etc.  or T01234.01, T01234.02 etc.

Examples:

##### Tier 1 (individual or small collection)
All material is collected and stored alongside the digital video file in a single directory which is given the unique ID as its title. For example:   [screen shot of material in one directory]

##### Tier 2 (small to medium sized collection)
All material is collected alongside the digital video file in a single directory using the unique ID as its title. This unique ID will also be used to link information about the artwork in any other systems used. For example, a database or a filing system.

##### Tier 3 (large collection)
Digital video file is stored by itself in a directory structure that uses the unique ID as an identifier for later ingest into a digital repository. Information about the artwork is stored in a directory structure that also conforms to the unique ID naming convention but is accessible across departments leveraging the institutions records management systems.

##Scoping Your System

### Collections Management
Metadata, Collections Management and Policies

* Do you have a collection information management system?
* Do you have a way of linking your digital objects to their records in the Collection Information Management system?
* Do you have acquisitions policies in place? That is, do you have guidelines on what master materials you require from artists/galleries?
* Do you hold descriptive and technical metadata for each digital object? e.g. information about video/audio containers, codecs, tape formats, file sizes etc.
* Do you have automated processes for extracting and storing this metadata?
* Do you reference published metadata strategies? e.g. Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)
* If you hold metadata , where is the metadata stored? e.g. separate Database and/or associated with the file
* Do you have a long term preservation policy for your digital collection?

In most cases the information about an art collection will be formed of a rich cluster of records that have been compiled and edited over time. Often only a fraction of this information is held within a central database. Many institutions will also have records management systems for this associated documentation. The information held within a database, often called a Collection Management System, forms the core information needed for the following functions:

* Providing an inventory of all collection items
* Recording acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information
* History of exhibitions or displays, including loans
* Tracking the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated
* Recording condition information  and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management

Depending on your context and the size of your collection, a collection management system will look very different. For a small institution or individual collector, collection management functionality could be carried out using a database or spreadsheets, templates and standardised metadata. For a larger institution, a managed database will be necessary in order to:

* provide a central information point with a consistent level of information about an entire collection regardless of medium or type
* facilitate certain core workflows (for example an acquisition process or loans process)
* provide auditing and reporting functions
* allow for access to information and the ability to edit information to be defined at a user level  
* allow for multiple users to update information and keep it current

The larger the number of users and objects and the more complex the workflows the more necessary a specialised database, ie. a collection management system, will become.

It is uncommon to find one system that will facilitate both the collections management activities outlined above, and also digital preservation. Therefore it is often the case that different systems and tools are used for serving these two different core needs – for instance the use of a digital asset management system, or a digital repository in addition to a Collection Management System. Before building or implementing any specialized systems beyond a Collection Management System however, it is important to consider how this specialized system will integrate and communicate with your collection management system.    

In a completely manual environment, you would be able to incorporate any additional information needed for the digital repository functions (for example checksum monitoring, format registry etc) and your core collection management information (for example location) into one database. For larger digital video collections there are significant gains to be made in terms of time and accuracy in taking advantage of tools that automate certain functions within the workflow. This often creates information about your video which you will wish to record and maintain. Where specialist (often proprietary) databases exist, integration with any repository software or digital asset management systems can be a challenging, expensive and skilled operation.

### Creating a Digital Repository

A digital repository for your collection is about more than just storage. There are many functions that can be carried out by a digital repository system in order to monitor and ensure the ongoing preservation of your collection objects. Just as for Collection Management systems, the way these functions are implemented will depend on individual circumstances. For a small, homogenous collection, many of these functions could be carried out manually. For a larger and more varied collection, there are significant benefits to having automated workflows and systems in place.

This is an area which has developed very rapidly in recent years, and many organisations have struggled to develop the infrastructure to keep pace with their growing digital video collections. It is therefore important to understand that the term repository refers to a number of functions which need to be carried out and which are underpinned by some of the key ideas to emerge regarding digital preservation practice.

These functions include:

* Automated workflows for the ingest of digital objects, including the extraction of metadata and packaging of the object and metadata for storage
* Generation of a persistent identifier for each digital object and a permanent relationship to associated metadata
* Generation of normalised masters where necessary. A normalised master is a preservation copy of a file in a standardised format. There is some debate regarding when the creation of normalised copies is advisable. In general video file formats are less vulnerable to obsolescence than tape formats. This is partly because it is easier to support software playback over time especially given open source tools such as ffmpeg. 
* Generation of access derivatives and an interface for user access to these derivatives, alongside associated metadata
* Generation of exhibition copies
* Auditing of system and user activities
* Active monitoring of file integrity
* Recording and reporting on collection characteristics, such as file formats
* Monitoring of preservation risks, e.g. file obsolescence and software dependencies

The problem of bit preservation of data has been solved, however it does require careful management. These principles can be applied to a small personal collection of material as well as a fully automated system used within a museum.

* store a complete set of data in three different places
* keep on copy in a different geographical location
* create a check sum and carry out regular fixity checks

When scoping your current storage infrastructure for the purposes of digital preservation it is helpful to understand the difference between standard storage set¬ups and those suitable for digital preservation. Standard storage systems are designed for digital objects that are in active use and while back¬up procedures are usually included, they generally do not meet the more stringent requirements to ensure long¬term preservation of data. For example, within a normal institutional information technology set up, it is standard practice for backup tapes to be wiped and re-used after a few months. Active use storage is also unlikely to have a system in place to identify that information has changed or been lost as when data is changing all the time it is not possible to easily detect the different between intended changes and accidental changes or damage to important data. In contrast, preservation storage systems require the active monitoring of data in order to detect unwanted changes such as corruption. They also have high level of redundancy meaning that material is copied in a number of locations to enable the data to be restored should a problem arise and they will also have a disaster recovery plan.
In assessing your current storage infrastructure, it may be useful to ask the following questions:

* What type of storage infrastructure do you have? (e.g. external hard drives, Direct Attached Storage (DAS), Network Attached Storage (NAS), magnetic tape, etc. )
* How many copies of any given digital object are maintained? Are these copies stored at different geographic locations?
* How do you know when a digital object has become corrupt or has been altered either unintentionally or maliciously?
* What measures are in place to prevent a corrupted or altered file from being replicated?
* What security and auditing measures are in place to prevent unwanted access and/or modification of your data?
* How are you tracking all of the files in multiple locations and on multiple mediums? (disk and tape)
* Do you have a disaster recovery plan in place?

Policies might relate to the following:

* the information you hold about an artwork
* the formats that you will accept into your repository
* under what circumstances you change the format of the material provided by the artist
* policies related to storage

## Developing Your System
This section will offer guidance on developing your own systems based on the nature of your collection and the available resources. These pages consider the different roles and responsibilities, hardware and software infrastructure and documentation models involved in developing a system for the preservation of video art and examine the processes that tie them together. This will serve as a resource guide for designing your preservation system.

Covering the basic concepts and requirements of redundancy, fixity and storage we will look at different ways in which this could be achieved, ranging from a simple manual system through to a large automated system. In partnership with storage it is also necessary to create a workstation with the ability to play, assess and provide access to the material held in your storage environment. An example workstation will also be described.

This section outlines the key elements associated with the design and build of reliable storage for long term digital preservation. The content has been arranged to address a range of situations; whether you are an individual who is designing a low risk personal storage solution, through to a large organisation. No matter the size of your collection the following core concepts need to be built into your storage:

* multiple copies stationed at different geographical locations,
* speed of and ease of access,
* redundancy,
* fixity

These concepts will be introduced and different methods for implementation will be explored through the 3 levels of storage design. Each level will be illustrated with a high level diagram around which the detail is organised.

#### Redundancy
The lifetime of a hard-drive varies from three months to five years. If you only have one hard drive and it breaks down, data recovery is very costly, and can be catastrophic. As a rule of thumb: One copy is no copy. Save your data on at least two mediums (e.g. hard drive, server, LTO tape, flash drive, cloud) and in at least two geographic locations.

In the guides provided for planning your storage and backup infrastructure, there are characteristics of types of storage pools. These characteristics are generally dictated by the purpose of any given copy of your data. A duplicate copy of your data may be maintained for high availability, disaster recovery, or recovery from accidental modification or deletion.

#### Types of copies
High-availability: This is a redundant copy of your data maintained for the ability to provide easy access to the data with no downtime in the event of loss of the primary copy. Typically this means an exact duplicate of the primary infrastructure at an off site location, with an equivalent connection to the outside world or access points. This infrastructure would contain a complete and up to date copy of your entire collection. With high-availability copies of data, ease of access is paramount.

Disaster recovery: When maintaining a copy of data for disaster (for instance, in the event of fire, flood, or earthquake) recovery purposes, the goal is simply to be able to retrieve, rebuild, and access your data. Within reason, ease of access is not a priority. An LTO tape stored off-site is one example of a suitable medium for a disaster recovery backup.

#### Fixity
When creating a secure storage environment for your data, you will want to make sure the data itself stays safe and does not change without your knowledge. This process is known as fixity, and is achieved by generating checksums for your files which are monitored by re-checking, on a regular basis.

Checksums are like a “fingerprint” for data. The most commonly used are MD5 and the SHA variety. Simply put, your file is run through a certain algorithm that produces a hexadecimal number sequence. The slightest change to your file will produce a completely different checksum. If you have an automatic monitoring system in place, it would alert you if such a change occurs. With this simple process, it is possible to identify any changes to your files. The types of changes which can be identified with this method are those which indicate corruption, loss of data, or unintended manipulation.

In any workflow it is important to create a checksum before any processing takes place, because handling, copying, and manipulating your files are all occasions where data corruption can occur. Calculate checksums as soon as you’ve received or created a file. This could mean creating checksums on the hard drive you received the artwork, or as you export a file from the hard drive on which an artwork was received, or as soon as you have exported a file from an editing program or on digitized a tape.

More advanced systems, like RAID 5 and up, provide data integrity on the block level of your storage system. These systems store your data in blocks of typically 512 bytes in various places (multiple disks) and checksum these blocks which can be comprised of various pieces of data. If one hard drive fails, the system can restore the lost data by using the redundant data block and the checksum. It is, however, only assuring the integrity of your volume and though it would detect any kind of data corruption, it would not alert you, if a file was accidentally deleted or changed by a user.

There are very simple and easy-to-use tools which can perform checksums. One of them is [Checksum+](http://www.julifos.com/soft/checksum/). With this tool you can just select a file and it will create a checksum for you, stored within an .md5 file, in the same location, with the same name as your file. Double-clicking this .md5 file will run a fixity check and tell you, if everything’s ok. If you open it with a text editor, it will show you the MD5 checksum as well as the file it is pointing to. It is important that both the .md5 and the original file are stored in the same folder.

A little more advanced is BagIt, developed by the Library of Congress, this tool is used in a command line interface. [BagIt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) was originally created to safely transfer files from one place to another, by packaging the original data in a ‘bag’ (folder) and creating checksums for each file within that bag. It also stores information about the date and software version as text-files within the bag, and creates checksums of all these text-files, including the checksum files themselves.

Both of these programs will not automatically check your checksums this is done manually if using these tools alone. There are also tools for automatically comparing checksums and identifying change (need to say more about this…)

AVPreserve has created a tool, [Fixity](http://www.avpreserve.com/avpsresources/tools/), that enables the user to identify seven directories that the program can check automatically on a monthly, weekly or daily basis.

When checking a checksum of a file, the result will indicate if there has been a change or not, it does not, however, indicate where or what or to which degree the file has changed. David Rice, Audiovisual Archivist at CUNY, [recommends](http://dericed.com/papers/reconsidering¬the¬checksum¬for¬audiovisual¬preservation/ ) generating frame-level checksums that can be created within [ffmpeg](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/framemd5%20Intro%20and%20HowTo). This frame-level approach creates a checksum for each frame of a video, so corruption or change can be tracked and pinned down by the frame.

This is what a check sum looks like: [ADD]

There is a debate about whether to checksum each frame or each video file (discuss pros and cons)

Here are some free tools to help….[ADD]

This is where checksums are carried out in an ingest workflow.[ADD]

This is when checksums can be carried out in a maintenance cycle.[ADD]

### Storage Options
In this section we describe three possible storage designs appropriate to three different levels: level 1 represents a small collection managed by one person with limited resources, whereas levels 2 and 3 represent increases in size of collection and resources.

Further to the storage options, the connections to the storage must be considered, as they will be a limiting factor. Large files can take very long to transfer over a network, so it is worth investing in faster connections. It is also important to consider that transferring files over a shared network will impact other users of that network.

#### Level 1
Level 1 is designed for individuals (artists, collectors, etc) or small institutions that have a small collection of digital material, in the region of 1-100 titles. Taking into account the limited amount of time and budget that is typical of this type of situation, this level is geared towards the basic steps necessary for providing secure digital storage. This scenario relies on off the shelf products and relatively user-friendly systems for storage to create safe, accessible and easy to accomplish storage.

Level 1 achieves the principle of 3 copies in 2 geographical locations in the following way:

On-site storage:  RAID 1

First copy at a different location: make a manual copy for the first off-site location

Second copy at a different location: Use a paid cloud or p2p storage for the second off-site copy.

[level 1 diagram goes here]

PRODUCTION/PRIMARY COPY: ON-SITE

This first copy could be as simple as having a copy on your PC, and or stored on a local external hard drive. An alternative solution could be an external RAID drive. RAID 1 requires no technical knowledge, it comprises of an external hard drive with dual bays (dual drives). When you copy your data to the RAID 1 a copy is saved on each of the bays. This means that should one of the 2 bays fail you have a back-up, this is known as redundancy (explanation in introduction to storage). Having two copies at your primary site is a good strategy, in the event of a basic error such as unintended deletion or corruption you have immediate access to your data.

##### STORAGE DEVICE: MANUAL OFF-SITE, OPTION 1
Creating an off-site manual copy could be as simple as saving your data on an external hard drive, or RAID 1 which is stored in a different geographic location. For example work and home, with a family member, friend or alternate work location, just as long as it’s a different geographic location so that you can recover from a disaster, such as computer drive failure, flood etc. In this case expect to spend the same amount as your primary on-site copy. In this case it is necessary to manually update the offsite version by travelling to that site. 
Storage device: Automated Off-site, option 2. Peer-to-Peer File Sharing (P2P)

##### WHAT IS PEER-TO-PEER (P2P)?
This is a method of distributing files between many computers, which has the benefit of allowing one to circumvent a third party, such as a commercial “cloud” storage service. Often P2P technology is used for the purpose of sharing files, providing the ability to download different bits of a file simultaneously from different peers, which offers a faster download speed than when downloading a file from one provider. However, in this context P2P technology can be used for the automatic synchronization of data across different geographic locations.
Through the use of special software, one can configure a network of 2 or more computers (nodes) in geographically distributed locations, to keep a set of data synchronized between them. Depending on the level of access and control one has over the nodes of this network, P2P technology can eliminate the need to manually manage copies for off-site redundancy. Some P2P file synchronization tools provide the ability to encrypt offsite copies, which could be desirable if nodes in your P2P network could potentially be accessed by untrusted parties.
This option offers a little more automation in that you do not need to physically visit the offsite location to update your second copy. 

##### STORAGE DEVICE: AUTOMATED OFF-SITE, OPTION 3. CLOUD STORAGE SERVICE
Cloud storage is a model of networked enterprise storage where data is stored in virtualized pools of storage which are generally hosted by third parties. Hosting companies operate large data centers, and people who require their data to be hosted buy or lease storage capacity from them. The data center operators, in the background, virtualize the resources according to the requirements of the customer and expose them as storage pools, which the customers can themselves use to store files or data objects. Physically, the resource may span across multiple servers and multiple locations. The safety of the files depends upon the hosting companies, and on the applications that leverage the cloud storage. Cloud storage services may be accessed through a web service application programming interface (API) or by applications that utilize the API, such as cloud desktop storage, a cloud storage gateway or Web based content management systems. Examples of cloud storage in 2014 include Dropbox and Google Drive, Glacier, Preseriva, and DuraCloud.

Following are the key points to remember for Cloud Storage Services:

* Charges on out-bound access can be leveraged based on per- request and per-byte -Check security policies offered by providers -???
* References [data transfer time calculator](http://www.calctool.org/CALC/prof/computing/transfer_time)
* Costs (based on 2015 prices)
* There are many personal paid cloud options which can range from $4.00-$10.00/£3.00-£7.00 per month.

#### Level 2
Level 2 is designed for medium sized collections of digital material (100 - 500 title) that have a modest budget and staff dedicated to the care and maintenance of a collection. This level is geared towards galleries, private collections and small institutions that have (or have the ability to hire) staff and infrastructure to implement and maintain this storage scenario. 

Level 2 recommends using a RAID 5 or similar system for the on-site copy and manually backing up to LTO or disk for first off-site copy and utilizing paid cloud storage or p2p for the second off-site copy. It is very similar to Level 1 with a few additional elements to allow for a few more users.

[level 2 diagram goes here]

#### Level 3
Level 3 is designed for collections with a significant amount of digital material (500+) as well as budget and staff dedicated to the care and maintenance of this collection. Examples of Level 3 collections would be public or private collecting institutions such as large libraries, museums and archives (for example the Museum of Modern Art, Tate, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the New York Public Library). These institutions have staff from different departments (IT, Conservation/Preservation, Curatorial, Registration, etc.) involved in the design and workflow of this storage scenario and have a dedicated budget allocated to the regular maintenance and care of their material as well as the storage infrastructure. Level 3 recommends using a scalable enterprise storage solution for the on-site copy and a similar solution for the first off-site copy, with other using automatic copying to LTO or using paid storage.

## Prepare your collection
### Pre-ingest procedures
Add intro text here applicable to all

### Ingest workflow examples 

#### MoMA
[ MoMA ingest workflows to come ]

#### SFMOMA
Incoming media	workflow_ACQUI.pdf

Digital works of art enter SFMOMA’s collection on various ways, be it a hand¬delivered thumb drive, a file sent via file share, or ¬as it is most often the case¬ sent via FedEx to our registrars’ attention. This physical medium is then tracked in our database.

Registration informs the media conservator of the arrival and the hard drive gets placed in the white media cabinet, next to the conservator’s workstation (location tracked in Embark). There it is in queue awaiting upload to the temporary RAID¬5 storage.

Temporary storage

As a first step to securing the media on the drive, the hard drive content gets bagged and transferred onto a RAID¬5. This in¬between step prior to uploading the files onto SFMOMA’s digital art server was established to serve two core necessities in managing the files:

1) to immediately create a higher level of redundancy and 2) to enable a fast connection to handle, replay and quality¬control the video files. This temporary storage additionally gives some time buffer in attending to the files for conservators and registrars.

Assessment of files

The media registrar and the media conservator meet once a week for two hours to assess, quality control and upload files to the digital art server. An initial assessment looks at the content of the hard drive and identifies the components (master file, exhibition copy, viewing copy, press images etc.) which later helps to create database entries.

After identifying the master file(s), both the media registrar and the conservator watch the whole video and fill out a corresponding data sheet that addresses technical metadata, content, provenance, and condition. This data sheet gets saved with the file on a file level and also uploaded into the database on the master file’s entry.

Preparing for ingest

After the quality control process, the file gets renamed to SFMOMA’s in¬house file naming system and the bag gets updated.

The media registrar updates the database record and adds components as discussed with the media conservator.

Ingest and LTO¬5 backup

After updating the bag, the artwork folder gets uploaded to SFMOMA’s digital art server. An additional copy onto LTO¬5 tape is made. This LTO¬5 tape gets shipped offsite to Iron Mountain.

## Store Your Collection
At this phase, you have gained intellectual control over your collection by way of survey, cataloging, pre-ingest, and assessment. We have also covered assessing needs and requirements for designing a digital storage system for your particular needs. It is now time to consider how one packages digital collections material for long-term preparation, before placing the material in storage.

The essential challenge here is to ensure that when one pulls a digital object from storage after many years have passed, that the archival package contains information that affords one the ability to understand what the materials are, how they can be viewed properly, their purpose in relation to the artwork to which they belong, and finally the ability to validate and prove their authenticity. The following types of information can be considered for inclusion in an archival package in order to facilitate these preservation requirements:

File/ Group of files

Core metadata

artist artwork title

identifying number you assign your works

Information about the intended purpose or purposes of the material in the package (for instance "Artist Verified Proof")

Representation information/ characterization information

Relationship information

Fixity of content and metadata

When including any type of identifier that serves as a linkage between systems – for example an identifier that refers to a record stored in a collections management system – it must be ensured that such identifiers are persistent, meaning they are permanent and will never change.
