Our aim is to provide information that is useful to those who are caring for their own collection of video artworks outside an institution, as well as small, medium and large organisations. Throughout these pages key principles are highlighted and approaches are suggested depending on the size of your collection and your available resources, namely skills, budget and infrastructure. For each section we invite you to fill in a survey, this will act as a tool to help you to outline the needs of your collection. The results will form the basis for an overall preservation system design.

<section id="Core-Principles" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

## Core Principles

* Do to digital works as you would to any art work: identify, catalog, describe, treat, document, and track
* Be prepared to be unprepared: the necessary skills evolve constantly and will be found both within and beyond your walls
* Build storage for your present collection but lay groundwork for the future
* The budget to build collection storage is nothing without the budget to sustain it
* Digital collections require active maintenance and will not survive passive storage


## Core Practices 

### Your collection

![](http://wiki.dpconline.org/images/7/76/ArchiveData_filingcabinet.png)


#### Collection size and characteristics

To plan and develop a system for digital art you will need to know some details about your collection and its possible growth. 

* Record descriptive and technical information about the works
* Capture information on both born-digital items and legacy material that will be migrated
* Monitor the growth patterns of your collection 
* Establish which collections are in the scope of your digital storage project

### Your Resources
[IMAGE]


#### Budget
Your budget may include costs for both preparing your collection for storage and establishing your storage infrastructure. 

* Legacy media migration
* Initial storage infrastructure
* Ongoing maintenance 
* Replacement and upgrade (every 5 years)
* Growth 
* People with expertise
* Consumables

#### Skills

To build a team able to address the needs of your collection: 
* Acquire new skills through workshops, research and conferences
* Leverage professional networks and community resources
* If you are in an institution, bring together staff from acorss departments, and collaborate with others outside your institution
* Consider the need for new roles and expertise

### Your Systems

#### Collection Management

[IMAGE]

Your collection management system is an essential complement to your storage infrastructure, and should enable you to: 

* Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all collection items

* Record acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information

* Record exhibition or displays history, including loans

* Track the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated

* Record condition information and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management

### Storage Infrastructure

Ensure that your storage infrastructure provides for:

* Geographic redundancy - multiple copies of data should be held at different geographical locations, and a disaster recovery plan should be in place

* Fixity checking - regularly monitoring digital files in order to detect corruption or unwanted changes to your data 

* Access and security - the speed and restriction of access to data needs to be appropriate for its intended use and the level of protection required.  

* Technology monitoring - trends in storage technology should be monitored to assess when migration to new storage media will be necessary

## Scoping Your Context

The best way to approach the challenge of sustaining your digital art depends on your context; a key element of this context is the nature of your collection. This section therefore focuses on assessing key facts about your collection of digital art, for example how large it is and what types of formats exist. The survey provided in this section is designed to help you to gather all the core information.

There are Core Principles that underpin the management of digital collections; however there are different ways (systems, tools, and procedures) to realise these Core Principles. The best way forward will depend on your context, i.e. the size of your collection, your infrastructure, available expertise and budget. This survey has been designed to help you to establish an overview of your digital collection.

###  Scoping your resources

####  Budget

When developing a budget for costs associated with the development and implementation of storage for digital art collections, there are two different types of cost to consider: capital costs (one-time purchases of fundamental infrastructure or tools that will in theory last years) and ongoing or recurring costs that will become part of regular operating budgets and may increase as your collections grow.

####  Skills 

The management of digital artworks requires different skills, and teamwork is essential. New skills may be acquired through education and training of existing staff, establishing new collaborations, or by hiring new staff or modifying job descriptions. Larger organisations might be able to pull together a team from across departments who together have these skills. 

If you are taking care of your own work, or if you are in a small organization, relationships with external providers may be a key way of accessing those who have the necessary skills.

### Scoping your systems

#### Collection Management 


[Image]

Whether you are an individual artist or large institution, the first step in sustaining your digital art is knowing what you have, where it is located and how you do things.  

Most museums and large institutions have comprehensive collection management databases for tracking their artworks, and digital storage for their data infrastructure. In museums, databases are usually managed by the registration and collections management department, and data storage is usually in the realm of IT. In order to evaluate your current systems for the management of collection information for digital artworks, talk to the registration and collections management teams as well as any IT staff supporting the systems. It is important to find out how current management systems are functioning, what they are technically capable of, for example what backup systems are already in place.

No matter which collection management system you currently use, as you work through "Scoping Your Context" it is likely that the type of information you will need to scope your collection may already be found within this system, or alternatively you might want to add the information you generate through this process to your inventory. 

In most cases the information about an art collection will be formed of a rich cluster of records that have been compiled and edited over time. Often only a fraction of this information is held within a central database. Many institutions will also have records management systems for this associated documentation.

#### Storage Infrastructure 

The problem of bit preservation of data has been solved, however it does require careful management.

These same principles can be applied to a small personal collection of material as well as a fully automated system used within a museum.

When scoping your current storage infrastructure for the purposes of digital preservation it is helpful to understand the difference between standard storage setups and those suitable for digital preservation. Standard storage systems are designed for digital objects that are in active use and while backup procedures are usually included, they generally do not meet the more stringent requirements to ensure long term preservation of data. For example, within a normal institutional information technology set up, it is standard practice for backup tapes to be wiped and re-used after a few months. Active use storage is also unlikely to have a system in place to identify that information has changed or been lost as when data is changing all the time it is not possible to easily detect the difference between intended changes and accidental changes or damage to important data. In contrast, preservation storage systems require the active monitoring of data in order to detect unwanted changes such as corruption. They also have high level of redundancy meaning that material is copied in a number of locations to enable the data to be restored should a problem arise and they will also have a disaster recovery plan.

In assessing your current storage infrastructure it may be useful to ask the following questions:



[inline of survey]

#### Preservation Management 

What is a digital repository?

A digital repository for your collection is about more than just storage. There are many functions that can be carried out by a digital repository system in order to monitor and ensure the ongoing preservation of your collection objects. Just as for Collection Management systems, the way these functions are implemented will depend on individual circumstances. For a small, homogenous collection, many of these functions could be carried out manually. For a larger and more varied collection, there are significant benefits to having automated workflows and systems in place.

This is an area which has developed very rapidly in recent years, and many organisations have struggled to develop the infrastructure to keep pace with their growing digital collections. It is therefore important to understand that the term repository refers to a number of functions which need to be carried out and which are underpinned by some of the key ideas to emerge regarding digital preservation practice. 

These functions include:

* Automated workflows for the ingest of digital objects, including the extraction of metadata and packaging of the object and metadata for storage

* Generation of a persistent identifier for each digital object and a permanent relationship to associated metadata

* Generation of normalised masters where necessary. A normalised master is a preservation copy of a file in a standardised format. There is some debate regarding when the creation of normalised copies is advisable. In general video file formats are less vulnerable to obsolescence than tape formats. This is partly because it is easier to support software playback over time especially given open source tools such as ffmpeg. 

* Generation of access derivatives and an interface for user access to these derivatives, alongside associated metadata

* Generation of exhibition copies

* Auditing of system and user activities

* Active monitoring of file integrity

* Recording and reporting on collection characteristics, such as file formats

* Monitoring of preservation risks, e.g. file obsolescence and software dependencies

## Developing Your Digital Environment
</section>


<section id="developing-your-collection-policies" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

### Developing your Collection Policies

Before embarking on developing systems for the preservation of your collection it is important to define your objectives. You will be able to use the information you’ve gathered in the “Scoping your Collection” section to help you make informed decisions.

If you work for a large organisation you may have some work to do in convincing management of the need for digital preservation. A good first step will be to develop a policy that aligns digital preservation with the strategic objectives of your organisation. The policy should also articulate the roles and responsibilities for digital preservation and identify key stakeholders. 

Regardless of the size of your collection, you will need to establish the following principles and parameters. These will help determine your requirements for systems and plan your resources. 

#### Define the scope of your collection 

In order to plan for the storage and management of your collection, it is useful to define the categories of collection items and associated documentation that you hold. This might include the following:

* Master files provided by the Artist
* Copies of the master file made for preservation purposes
* Copies of the master file migrated to other formats or carriers
* Derivatives of the file made for access, exhibition or loan
* Documentation created or received relating to the creation process and intended display of the artwork
You will then need to consider 

> “I focus on keeping master materials of my work on the hard drives I call my “archive.” I don’t have an organized way to keep the derivative files I’ve made for various other uses. Sometimes they don’t make it into the archive, but I figure I can make any format if I have the master.”

> “We generally receive whatever the artist delivers us, though we have been making more of an effort to get master material. The bulk of the digital collection is H.264 .mov files for screening as well as ProRes or Uncompressed masters when we are able to receive them from the artist or gallery. In addition, we have been actively migrating our analog tape material to digital master files.”

> “We keep every file we receive from the artist. When we create derivatives for preservation purposes, exhibition, or loan, every new file is given a component number in our collection management system and stored in the repository, along with details about the creation of those files. We make an access copy that goes into our DAM, so that our staff can view the collection without needing direct access to the digital repository.”

#### Organizing information about your collection 

You may have information about an artwork held in different places. This might include a Collection Management system, artwork records or metadata held with your digital files. 

The challenge here is to ensure that when you pull a digital object from storage after many years have passed you will have the information you need to understand what the materials are, how they can be viewed properly, their purpose in relation to the artwork to which they belong, and finally the ability to validate and prove their authenticity.

There is a certain amount of information you should make sure is held with the files, so that even if other information is lost, you still know what artwork it is and that the file itself has not changed. 

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Core descriptive information</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>Artwork title and Artist Name. If you have a Collection Management System the descriptive information should also include an identifier to that artwork’s record. These identifiers must be persistent, meaning they are permanent and will never change.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</li>
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Fixity</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>which will allow you to check that the file has remained unchanged (see section 2b for more information)</li>
    </ul>  
  </div>
</li>
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Technical Information</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>The file will have technical information embedded in its header or wrapper. If you have a large collection, you should also consider extracting this information and storing it elsewhere, so that you can search across your collection.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</li>
</ul>

There is further information that will need to be kept in order to ensure an artwork can be preserved and displayed in the future. This can be either kept with the file or in other systems, like a database or Collection Management System.

####Adhering to standards and best practices 
Digital Preservation is a relatively new and rapidly evolving field, but there are already a number of established standards for the management of digital objects and metadata. Adhering to these standards helps ensure that your files can be correctly identified and interpreted in the future, and that you will be able to share information about your collection between different systems. 

The most widely recognised standard for digital preservation is the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2000/lavoie-oais.html">Open Archival Information System (OAIS)</a>, developed by NASA and approved as an international standard in 2003. OAIS is a conceptual framework that defines the entities that make up an archive. Defining your designated community and ensuring that objects can be accessed and understood by this community are important concepts. The Trusted Digital Repository checklist is a useful tool for measuring your systems against the OAIS standard. 

Recording information about your collection in a standardised way will help ensure that the information can be accessed and understood in the future. It will also mean that systems will recognise this information and be able to use, share and index it. Examples of metadata and packaging standards are:
BagIt - A standard developed by the Library of Congress for the packaging of files with critical metadata, such as checksum information 

<a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> - A standard for recording descriptive metadata 

<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS</a> - An international standard for metadata to support the preservation of digital objects and ensure their long-term usability 

<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a> - a standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata. 

####Define your preservation strategy 

### Collection Management 
The information held within a database, often called a Collection Management System, forms the core information needed for the following functions:

* Providing an inventory of all collection items
* Recording acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information
* History of exhibitions or displays, including loans
* Tracking the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated
Recording condition information  and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management

Depending on your context and the size of your collection, a collection management system will look very different. For a small institution or individual collector, collection management functionality could be carried out using a database or spreadsheets, templates and standardised metadata. For a larger institution, a managed database will be necessary in order to:

* provide a central information point with a consistent level of information about an entire collection regardless of medium or type
* facilitate certain core workflows (for example an acquisition process or loans process)
provide auditing and reporting functions
* allow for access to information and the ability to edit information to be defined at a user level  
* allow for multiple users to update information and keep it current

The larger the number of users and objects and the more complex the workflows the more necessary a specialised database, ie. a collection management system, will become. Software to maintain an inventory could range from an Excel spreadsheet, a database like Filemaker, an open source collection management software such as CollectiveAccess (http://www.collectiveaccess.org/about) or Omeka (http://omeka.org/about/) to the type of collection management system employed by museums, for example The Museum System (TMS), Mimsy or a bespoke system developed by your institution. 

It is uncommon to find one system that will facilitate both the collections management activities outlined above, and also digital preservation. Therefore it is often the case that different systems and tools are used for serving these two different core needs – for instance the use of a digital asset management system, or a digital repository in addition to a Collection Management System. Before building or implementing any specialized systems beyond a Collection Management System however, it is important to consider how this specialized system will integrate and communicate with your collection management system.    
In a completely manual environment, you would be able to incorporate any additional information needed for the digital repository functions (for example checksum monitoring, format registry etc) and your core collection management information (for example location) into one database. For larger digital collections there are significant gains to be made in terms of time and accuracy in taking advantage of tools that automate certain functions within the workflow. This often creates information about your digital artworks which you will wish to record and maintain. Where specialist (often proprietary) databases exist, integration with any repository software or digital asset management systems can be a challenging, expensive and skilled operation.

  <div class="collapsible-body"><p>A conservator of any type of material has a responsibility to understand and carefully document decisions made which impact the history of that material. This is also the case for digital video. The conservator is responsible for keeping careful records which reflect an understanding of what is important to preserve about a work and what the likely risks are of not being able to maintain particular properties of a work. Within a contemporary art context the artist is central to decisions regarding what is important to preserve about a work and this ongoing dialogue with the artist is an important element of what is recorded.

### Developing Your Systems and Processes 

This section will offer guidance on developing your own systems based on the nature of your collection and the available resources. These pages consider the different roles and responsibilities, hardware and software infrastructure and documentation models involved in developing a system for the preservation of digital art and examine the processes that tie them together. This will serve as a resource guide for designing your preservation system.

####  Collection Management 
Information about your collection that’s held in one location, often called a Collection Management System, forms the core of your collection’s management and allows for the following functions: 
Providing an inventory of all collection items
Recording acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information
History of exhibitions or displays, including loans
Tracking the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated
Recording condition information  and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management

“I used to use a spreadsheet, but it got unwieldy with too many objects. It’s also designed for calculations and data manipulation, not keeping discrete object records. I now have a database that can accommodate much more information, and is much easier to navigate and search.” 
Depending on your context and the size of your collection, a collection management system will look very different. For a small institution or individual collector, collection management functionality could be carried out using a database or spreadsheets, templates and standardised metadata. For a larger institution, a managed database will be necessary in order to:
provide a central information point with a consistent level of information about an entire collection regardless of medium or type
facilitate certain core workflows (for example an acquisition process or loans process)
provide auditing and reporting functions
allow for access to information and the ability to edit information to be defined at a user level  
allow for multiple users to update information and keep it current
The larger the number of users and objects and the more complex the workflows the more necessary a specialised database, ie. a collection management system, will become. Software to maintain an inventory could range from an Excel spreadsheet, a database like Filemaker, an open source collection management software such as CollectiveAccess (http://www.collectiveaccess.org/about) or Omeka (http://omeka.org/about/) to the type of collection management system employed by museums, for example The Museum System (TMS), Mimsy or a bespoke system developed by your institution. 

“We use a free, web-based open source database that’s designed for museums. It allows us to assign everything a unique identifier which is connected to the main artwork. We can add acquisition, loan, and location information to the main record, and even use barcodes to track movement of physical collection objects.”
It is uncommon to find one system that will facilitate both the collections management activities outlined above, and also digital preservation. Therefore it is often the case that different systems and tools are used for serving these two different core needs – for instance the use of a digital asset management system, or a digital repository in addition to a Collection Management System. Before building or implementing any specialized systems beyond a Collection Management System however, it is important to consider how this specialized system will integrate and communicate with your collection management system.

“We are a museum using TMS. We create an object record for the work and then create separate components for each physical or digital object that is part of that work. It enables us to record attributes, relationships, and contextual information, effectively centralizing the essential information about complex works with many elements.”
